		<h1>How Edible Coating Works</h1>
		<div class="sct-1">
		
		<p>Edible Coating keeps produce fresh for longer thanks to the help of a little extra 'peel'.
		   Our plant-based protection slows water loss and oxidation,
		   the primary causes of spoilage.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   

		    Edible Coating dramatically slows the rate that produce spoils. 
			By maintaining moisture and reducing oxidation, 
			Edible coating supports the plant’s natural abilities to protect against environmental stress.</p>

			<h2>Learning from nature - mimicking the cuticle layer.</h2>
			
			
			
			
			<p>Every plant on Earth has a peel that protects it. The top layer of the peel is called 
			   the cuticle layer, which keeps moisture in while allowing the plant to breathe without drying out.
			   Edible Coating protects fresh produce by forming a thin edible “peel” on the fruit's surface,
			   similar to the plant’s cuticle layer.</p>

			<h2>Made from food to protect your food.</h2>
			
			
			
			

			<p>Edible Coating is composed entirely of purified monoglycerides and diglycerides, 
			   edible compounds that can be found in a variety of foods. <br> They are safe to eat as
			   verified by regulatory authorities around the world, including Health Canada, the United 
			   States Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
			   and the World Health Organization (WHO). In fact, they are so safe they can be found in
			   products designed for the most sensitive populations, including infant formula and nutrition shakes for the elderly.</p>
